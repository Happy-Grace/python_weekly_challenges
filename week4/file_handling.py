# Challenge: 
# Create a program that reads a text file, processes its content, 
# and writes the results to a new file.

# ðŸ“Œ Task Requirements:
    # Create a file called input.txt and write at least five lines of text into it.
    # Write a Python script to:
        # 1. Read the contents of input.txt.
        # 2. Count the number of words in the file.
        # 3. Convert all text to uppercase.
        # 4. Write the processed text and the word count to a new file called output.txt.
        # 5. Print a success message once the new file is created.


# 1. FIRST, Create a file named input.txt and writeat least five lines of text into it.
